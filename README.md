Your Python Package NameReplace YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME, YOUR_REPO_NAME, and your_package_name in the badges and throughout this README.A concise, one-sentence description of your package and what it does.üåü FeaturesFeature 1: Briefly explain a key feature.Feature 2: Briefly explain another key feature.Feature 3: ... and so on.üöÄ InstallationThis project uses pyproject.toml for standard Python packaging, managed with setuptools. You can install it directly from this repository using pip in an editable mode, which is great for development.Prerequisites:Python 3.8 or higher (check requires-python in your pyproject.toml)pip (usually comes with Python)gitSteps:Clone the Repository:git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git](https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git)
cd YOUR_REPO_NAME
Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other projects.Using venv (Recommended, built-in):python -m venv .venv
# On Linux/macOS:
source .venv/bin/activate
# On Windows (Cmd Prompt):
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
# On Windows (PowerShell):
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
Using conda (If you use Anaconda/Miniconda):conda create -n your_package_env python=<compatible_python_version>
conda activate your_package_env
Replace <compatible_python_version> with a version compatible with your project (e.g., 3.9).Install the Package:With your virtual environment activated, install the package using pip. The -e . flag installs it in "editable" mode, meaning changes you make to the source code are immediately reflected without needing to reinstall. pip will read your pyproject.toml and install all necessary dependencies listed there.pip install -e .
Verify Installation (Optional):You can check if the package and its dependencies were installed correctly:pip list
You should see your_package_name listed, pointing to your local source directory.‚ú® UsageProvide simple examples showing how to use your package.Example 1: Using the package in a Python script# my_script.py
import your_package_name

# Assuming your package has a function or class
result = your_package_name.some_function(input_data)
print(result)
To run this script after installation:# Make sure your virtual environment is activated
python my_script.py
Example 2: Using a command-line script (if defined in pyproject.toml)If you defined command-line entry points in the [project.scripts] section of your pyproject.toml, explain how to use them.# Make sure your virtual environment is activated
your-command --option value input_file
Explain what the command does and its arguments/options.ü§ù ContributingWe welcome contributions!
